Appearance: 
    The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. Its herbivore diet 
    gives its fat a grennish color, as highlighted by their name. 

Behavior: 
    Green sea turtles primarily consume algae and seagrasses, but they are known to
    occasionally forage sponges, invertebrates, and discarded fish (fish that are
    caught and then released for a variety of different reasons).

Life:
    Like all other reptiles, they also must surface to breath and lay their eggs on land.
    They are long-lived, reaching up to 70 years in age. They spend most of their 
    adult lives, after around age 30, in shallow coastal habitats.

Location:
    Green sea turtles can be found worldwide in subtropical and temperate regions throughout
    the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Hence, it is important for all the countries
    where they exist to work together for their protection and recovery.

Threats:
    - Unintended capturing leading to death or debilitation
    - Direct harvest of turtles and eggs (for fat, meat, and eggs)
    - Loss and degredation of nesting habitats
    - Vessel strikes (watercrafts hitting turtles during operation)
    - Ocean pollution
    - Climate Change 
    - Disease (Fibropapillomatosis ~ causes external and internal tumors)

Interesting Fact:
    There are actually two subspecies of Hector's Dolphins. One goes by the name of 
    Hector's dolphin, and the other is known as Maui's dolphin.

Appearance: 
    Unlike the green sea turtle, who are the largest of their kind, Hector's 
    dolphins are the world's smallest dolphins. They have no external beak and a
    relatively large fluke. Their distinct gray, black, and white coloring changes as
    they age into an adult, when the sides of their head, tail, dorsal fin, and flippers,
    become black, their throat, lower jaw, and belly become white, and the rest become
    mainly gray. The females of both subspecies reach larger sizes than the males.

Behavior:
    They occur in small groups of typically 2-4 dolphins, but up to 20. They tend to 
    involve themselves in bubble-blowing, leaping, lobtailinng (smacking water with their fluke), 
    and spyhopping (holding the body vertically above the water surface).

    Hector's dolphins tend to feed on cephalopods, crustaceans, and small fish species. 
    Some of these species include red cod, arrow squid, and stargazer.

Life:
    Both subspecies live up to at least 22 years of age. Adulthood is reached at about
    6-9 years of age, and females normally produce single calves every 2-4 years.

Location:
    Maui's dolphin and Hector's dolphin occur around the North and South Islands of New Zealand
    respectively. 

Threats:
    - Low population growth
    - Unintended capturing
    - Tourism
    - Disease
