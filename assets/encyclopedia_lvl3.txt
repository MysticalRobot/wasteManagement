Appearance: 
    The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. Its herbivore diet 
    gives its fat a grennish color, as highlighted by their name. 

Behavior: 
    Green sea turtles primarily consume algae and seagrasses, but they are known to
    occasionally forage sponges, invertebrates, and discarded fish (fish that are
    caught and then released for a variety of different reasons).

Life:
    Like all other reptiles, they also must surface to breath and lay their eggs on land.
    They are long-lived, reaching up to 70 years in age. They spend most of their 
    adult lives, after around age 30, in shallow coastal habitats.

Location:
    Green sea turtles can be found worldwide in subtropical and temperate regions throughout
    the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Hence, it is important for all the countries
    where they exist to work together for their protection and recovery.

Threats:
    - Unintended capturing leading to death or debilitation
    - Direct harvest of turtles and eggs (for fat, meat, and eggs)
    - Loss and degredation of nesting habitats
    - Vessel strikes (watercrafts hitting turtles during operation)
    - Ocean pollution
    - Climate Change 
    - Disease (Fibropapillomatosis ~ causes external and internal tumors)

Interesting Fact:
    There are actually two subspecies of Hector's Dolphins. One goes by the name of 
    Hector's dolphin, and the other is known as Maui's dolphin.

Appearance: 
    Unlike the green sea turtle, who are the largest of their kind, Hector's 
    dolphins are the world's smallest dolphins. They have no external beak and a
    relatively large fluke. Their distinct gray, black, and white coloring changes as
    they age into an adult, when the sides of their head, tail, dorsal fin, and flippers,
    become black, their throat, lower jaw, and belly become white, and the rest become
    mainly gray. The females of both subspecies reach larger sizes than the males.

Behavior:
    They occur in small groups of typically 2-4 dolphins, but up to 20. They tend to 
    involve themselves in bubble-blowing, leaping, lobtailinng (smacking water with their fluke), 
    and spyhopping (holding the body vertically above the water surface).

    Hector's dolphins tend to feed on cephalopods, crustaceans, and small fish species. 
    Some of these species include red cod, arrow squid, and stargazer.

Life:
    Both subspecies live up to at least 22 years of age. Adulthood is reached at about
    6-9 years of age, and females normally produce single calves every 2-4 years.

Location:
    Maui's dolphin and Hector's dolphin occur around the North and South Islands of New Zealand
    respectively. 

Threats:
    - Low population growth
    - Habitat degredation
    - Climate Change 
    - Pollution
    - Unintended capturing
    - Tourism
    - Disease

Interesting Fact:
    Blue whales have unique patterns that can be used to identity individuals.

Appearance:
    Blue whales are the largest animals to ever live on our planet. Antarctic blue whale
    tend to be larger than North Atlantic and North Pacific blue whales. The former grow
    up to 110 feet long and weigh more than 330,000 pounds whereas the latter only grow up
    to about 90 feet and over 100,000 pounds. They have a long body and generally slender shape. 
    Unsurprisingly, their blue-gray colored bodies, that appear light blue under water, give 
    them their name.

Behavior:
    Sometimes, blue whales swim in small groups, but are they often found alone or in pairs.
    They spend their time eating up to 6 tons of krill a day. They are among the loudest animals
    in the world, with sounds emitted by blue whales being heard by other whales up to 1000 miles 
    away. They typically coast at 5 miles an hour, but they can reach speeds up to 20 miles per hour.

Life:
    Blue whales live for around 80-90 on average. During summers, they feed in polar waters, but in 
    winters, they migrate towards equatorial water. Besides approximate ages, scientists do not actually
    know much about the life history of the blue whale.
    
Location:
    Blue whales exist in all oceans except the Arctic. 

Threats:
    - Vessel strikes
    - Entaglement in fishing generally
    - Ocean noise
    - Habitat degredation
    - Climate Change 
    - Pollution
