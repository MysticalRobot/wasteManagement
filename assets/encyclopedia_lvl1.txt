Appearance: 
    The green sea turtle is the largest hard-shelled sea turtle. Its herbivore diet 
    gives its fat a grennish color, as highlighted by their name. 

Behavior: 
    Green sea turtles primarily consume algae and seagrasses, but they are known to
    occasionally forage sponges, invertebrates, and discarded fish (fish that are
    caught and then released for a variety of different reasons).

Life:
    Like all other reptiles, they also must surface to breath and lay their eggs on land.
    They are long-lived, reaching up to 70 years in age. They spend most of their 
    adult lives, after around age 30, in shallow coastal habitats.

Location:
    Green sea turtles can be found worldwide in subtropical and temperate regions throughout
    the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Hence, it is important for all the countries
    where they exist to work together for their protection and recovery.

Threats:
    - Unintended capturing leading to death or debilitation
    - Direct harvest of turtles and eggs (for fat, meat, and eggs)
    - Loss and degredation of nesting habitats
    - Vessel strikes (watercrafts hitting turtles during operation)
    - Ocean pollution
    - Climate Change 
    - Disease (Fibropapillomatosis ~ causes external and internal tumors)
